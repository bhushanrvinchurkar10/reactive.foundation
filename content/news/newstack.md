The list of foundations hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) continues growing this week with the launch of the [Reactive Foundation](https://reactive.foundation/), “a community of leaders established to accelerate technologies for building the next generation of networked applications,” according to a statement. Upon founding, those leaders will include Alibaba, Facebook, Netifi and Pivotal, with the open source [RSocket](https://github.com/rsocket) specification and programming language implementations also joining the new foundation’s “formal open governance model and neutral ecosystem.”

RSocket provides a basis for reactive programming at the protocol level and lays the groundwork for reactive programming in cloud native environments, [Ryland Degnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjdegnan), co-founder and CTO at Netifi, said in an interview with The New Stack. It’s considered a replacement for HTTP in cloud native communications.
