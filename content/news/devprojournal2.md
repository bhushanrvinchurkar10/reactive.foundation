The Linux Foundation has announced the [launch of the Reactive Foundation](https://www.devprojournal.com/technology-trends/the-reactive-foundation-launches-to-support-next-phase-of-software-architecture/), which establishes a formal governance model for supporting open-source reactive programming projects. The foundation’s initial members are Alibaba, Facebook, Netifi and Pivotal, and it includes open source [RSocket](https://github.com/rsocket) specification and programming language implementations. RSocket, created by Netflix, is designed to support reactive programming and enable microservices-based and cloud applications to replace HTTP with a more efficient, high-performance alternative.

Ryland Degnan, Co-Founder and CTO at Netifi and Reactive Foundation community chair, told DevPro Journal, “The foundation is the outcome of a long-term collaboration among the founding companies. The idea was to find the best way to build software that’s scalable and that reacts to changes within the system.”
