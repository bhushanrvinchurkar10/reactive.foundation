title: About the Reactive Foundation
description: Who's behind the Foundation
---

The Reactive Foundation is made up of [Alibaba](https://alibaba.github.io/), [Facebook](https://opensource.facebook.com/), [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com) [Netifi](https://www.netifi.com/), and [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io/) as initial members and includes the highly successful [RSocket](https://rsocket.io) specification and implementations.

The foundation establishes a formal open governance model for supporting open source reactive programming projects and builds a neutral ecosystem around reactive programming.

Building modern, cloud native applications often require reactive systems that are responsive, resilient, elastic and message driven. The Reactive Foundation offers a neutral ecosystem of support for open source projects enabling developers building reactive applications on cloud native infrastructure. For more information on these core principles, see the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/).
