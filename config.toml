"""
As application development shifts towards microservices architectures with an emphasis on flexibility and speed to market, tools like GraphQL are redefining API design and client-server interaction to improve the developer experience. GraphQL makes cross-platform and mobile development simpler with availability in the programming language of your choice, while allowing developers to create seamless user experiences for their customers.

Airbnb, Apollo, Coursera, Elementl, Facebook, GitHub, Hasura, Prisma, Shopify, and Twitter are working together to form a new, vendor-neutral foundation that will provide unified governance and stewardship for GraphQL.

"""
Hosted under the Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, the Foundationâ€™s mission will be to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of GraphQL and the surrounding ecosystem.

The Foundation will combine resources to provide financial and intellectual resources, infrastructure, outreach services, events, and training. We invite others to join us to empower the community and ensure long-term technical success for GraphQL.
